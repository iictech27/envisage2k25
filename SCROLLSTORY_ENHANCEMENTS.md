# ScrollStory Component Enhancements

## Overview

The ScrollStory component has been significantly enhanced with advanced 3D elements, neon effects, and interactive animations to create a more immersive and engaging user experience. These enhancements align with the overall neon theme and ultra-3D aesthetic of the Metaverse landing page.

## Key Enhancements

### 3D Elements

- **3D Canvas Backgrounds**: Each section now has a dedicated 3D scene with unique sphere arrangements
- **Floating Animation**: Objects now have realistic floating animations with subtle rotations
- **Perspective Effects**: Added proper 3D perspective to create depth in the UI

### Neon Effects

- **Enhanced Neon Text**: Improved text glow effects with pulsating animations
- **Glitch Text Effect**: Added cyberpunk-style glitch effects to section headings
- **Neon Glow**: Portal rings and UI elements now have animated neon glow effects
- **Data Line Animations**: Added shimmering effects to data visualization elements

### Interactive Elements

- **Hover Effects**: Enhanced hover states for buttons, cards, and interactive elements
- **Navigation Dots**: Added a fixed navigation system to easily jump between story sections
- **Animated Cards**: Identity cards now have entrance animations and interactive hover states
- **Cyber Buttons**: Redesigned buttons with neon effects and hover animations

### Animation Improvements
